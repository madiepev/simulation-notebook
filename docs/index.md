## Welcome to Interactive Notebooks

These interactive notebook simulations let you experience Jupyter notebooks directly in your browser. You can:

- **🏃‍♂️ Run code cells** with realistic execution timing
- **📊 See outputs** appear as they would in a real notebook  
- **🤔 Answer reflection questions** to test your understanding
- **📈 Track your progress** through each notebook

### How to Use

1. **Click the ▶ Run button** on any code cell to execute it
2. **Wait for the output** to appear (simulated execution time)
3. **Answer reflection questions** that appear after code blocks
4. **Use keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to run the current cell

### Features

- **Realistic simulation** of Jupyter notebook environment
- **Progressive learning** with built-in comprehension checks
- **Mobile responsive** design for learning on any device
- **Lightweight** conversion from existing notebooks

### 🚀 Featured Notebook

**[📚 Step 2: Customize The Tone & Style With SFT]({{ '/notebooks/01-basic-fine-tuning/' | relative_url }})**  
Learn how to fine-tune GPT models to improve tone and style with shorter prompts using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This interactive simulation walks you through the complete fine-tuning process with hands-on code execution and reflection questions.
